![](https://skaji.github.io/images/cpm-Plack.svg)

## Install

There are 2 ways.

### 1) self-contained version

```sh
$ curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skaji/cpm/main/cpm > cpm
$ chmod +x cpm
$ ./cpm --version
```

### 2) From CPAN

```sh
$ curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skaji/cpm/main/cpm | perl - install -g App::cpm
$ cpm --version
```

## Description

cpm is a fast CPAN module installer, which uses
[Menlo](https://metacpan.org/pod/Menlo) (cpanm 2.0) in parallel.

Moreover cpm keeps the each builds of distributions in your home directory.
Then, `cpm install` will use these prebuilt distributions.
That is, if prebuilts are available, cpm never build distributions again, just copy the prebuilts into an appropriate directory.
This is (of course!) inspired by [Carmel](https://github.com/miyagawa/Carmel).
